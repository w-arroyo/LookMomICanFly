'Look Mom I Can Fly' is my academic degree closing project. The idea behind this project is develop a web-based application mimicking an actual professional workflow.
The platform serves as marketplace that allows users to buy and sell "hype" products (popular culture famous items) such as sneakers, clothing, electronics, skateboards or vinyls. 
You can check all the steps and challenges i faced throughtout the development of this project in the GitHub Issues section (it's in spanish tho cause it's my mother languaje).
This repository contains the backend side of the project which was developed with Spring Boot (Java's most popular framework).
All code went through JUnit's Mockito unitary tests and Sonarqube's quality control to ensure it works correctly and preventing non-working/non-functional code from being integrated to the main branch of the project.
To use this project you need to downlaod the zip file (in Code section) and then unzip the files in your computer. After that just run the main file in IntelliJ and Gradle will build the full project.
Make sure to download the frontend side of the project too. It's located on my LookMomICanFly_Frotend repository. Follow the instructions on the readme.md file.
